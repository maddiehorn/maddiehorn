## Work Experience
### Business Analyst, Data Science and Data Management
#### GreenLight Biosciences
**Feb 2021 - Present**
I currently work part time as a Business Analyst on the Data Science and Data Management team at GreenLight Biosciences. When I graduate, I will transition into a full-time role. I work as a liaison between internal stakeholders and our development team. I help gather requirements from scientists and guide our development team to create software solutions to meet the needs of the business.

### ERP Analyst
#### Ilera Healthcare
**May 2020 - Feb 2021**
I worked on an ERP implementation project within a manufacturing facility, as well as in a retail facility that included an API integration with a third party POS system. Additionally, I compiled much of the master data as it pertains to our manufacturing and operations, including the Item Master and Bills of Material. Much of my work involved understanding the varying needs of each business unit and working with management to identify how to fit the ERP into the current business processes. Additionally, I was responsible for training end users on how to use the system for their day-to-day functions.

## Internships

### Ainsworth Pet Nutrition 
**June 2016 - Jan 2018**
I worked for two summers and a winter break as an intern with Ainsworth Pet Nutrition. My first summer, I worked in the Quality Assurance department, and my biggest project was investigating bag weight fill accuracy. My second summer, I worked with the Research and Development team to find a natural source of green food coloring.

### Bayer Pharmaceuticals
**May 2019 - Aug 2019**
I worked on several continuous improvement projects during my summer at Bayer. I helped the Packaging department understand key drivers variability in their thermoformed packaging, and I developed live dashboards in Microsoft PowerBI for KPI reporting. My biggest project, however, was developing an app to collect batch data on the shop floor using Microsoft's PowerApps.
