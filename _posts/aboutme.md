I attended Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP), which is located in the small town of Indiana, PA. In 2020, I graduated with my B.S. in Biochemistry, along with a minor in Mathematics. My undergraduate research focused on the interaction between antidepressants and fluctuations in menstrual cycle hormones.

This May, I will graduate from Cornell University with my Masterâ€™s of Engineering in Biomedical Engineering. During my time at Cornell, I worked on a research project sponsored by West Pharmaceuticals investigating adverse events related to injections.
